This is a viewer for files that are exported from CarbonFin's Outliner for iPad. It is a small project I use myself and not even close to official.
Right now it quite literally has no features. 
It reads a opml file that is dropped on the target and builds an HTML list from that. That's it. Currently I only successfully tested it in Chrome.
